Applying a function to a value and creating a new value is called a projection. To project one array into another, we apply a projection function to each item in the array and collect the results in a new array.

# Project an array of videos into an array of {id,title} pairs using forEach()
## For each video, add a projected {id, title} pair to the videoAndTitlePairs array.
